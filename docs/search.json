I am fluent in Python, C++, and\r\nJava, and familiar with a variety of other languages including R, which\r\nwas used to make this project. Outside of coding, I am a regular\r\nmountain hiker during the warmer months in New England and a somewhat\r\nactive one in the winter.\r\nAbout the Project\r\nI chose to do a project on monkeypox due to my interest in\r\nepidemiology which was sparked during the COVID-19 pandemic two years\r\nago, in addition to my desire to help disperse the stigma around who the\r\nvirus may possibly be disproportionately affecting. I was also able to\r\nfind sufficient data enabling me to do an acceptable level of data\r\nanalysis.\r\nContact Links\r\nGitHub\r\nProject\r\nrepository\r\nEmail\r\nCredits\r\nThis was my final project for the Kane’s Free Data Science\r\nBootcamp. Consider participating; it will teach you a lot in a very\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first glance, the current outbreak of monkeypox would appear to be\r\ndisproportionately affecting men, with over 95% of confirmed cases being\r\nrecorded in such people. The dataset is from global.health, compiling\r\nindividual case data originally from a number of governmental\r\ninstitutions worldwide. The data was then cleaned up and plotted in a\r\nstraightforward manner. While it may appear that monkeypox only impacts\r\ngay and bisexual men, this conclusion doesn’t complement past outbreaks,\r\nand is possibly due to deficits in testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
