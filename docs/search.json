I am fluent in Python, C++, and\r\nJava, and familiar with a variety of other languages including R, which\r\nwas used to make this project. Outside of coding, I am a regular\r\nmountain hiker during the warmer months in New England and a somewhat\r\nactive one in the winter.\r\nAbout the Project\r\nI chose to do a project on monkeypox due to my interest in\r\nepidemiology which was sparked during the COVID-19 pandemic two years\r\nago, in addition to my desire to help disperse the stigma around who the\r\nvirus may possibly be disproportionately affecting. I was also able to\r\nfind sufficient data enabling me to do an acceptable level of data\r\nanalysis.\r\nContact Links\r\nGitHub\r\nProject\r\nrepository\r\nEmail\r\nCredits\r\nThis was my final project for the Kane’s Free Data Science\r\nBootcamp. Consider participating; it will teach you a lot in a very\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nFor this plot, I will analyze the distribution of monkeypox cases by\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe graph above demonstrates a standard bell-curve distribution, with\r\ncases being most common in adults between their late twenties and early\r\nforties.\r\nAnalysis\r\nFrom this graph one can conclude that adults in their thirties are\r\nmost likely to get monkeypox. This is a logical conclusion since one of\r\nthe main ways monkeypox spreads is through sexual contact, and people of\r\nthis age group are generally the most sexually active. This distribution\r\nwill be refined as more data becomes available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor these plots, I am going to compare the hospitalization rates for\r\nmonkeypox in countries in North America and Europe, the two main regions\r\nimpacted by the outbreak this year. Since the United States and Italy\r\nhave the most hospitalization data in their respective regions, I will\r\nuse these for my comparison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chart demonstrates that the majority of monkeypox cases in the\r\nUS so far have not resulted in hospitalization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis graph shows that just over a simple majority of monkeypox cases\r\nin Italy have resulted in hospitalization. This is over three times as\r\ncommon as hospitalization in the US.\r\nAnalysis\r\nBased on what we see above, one can conclude that hospitalization\r\nfrom monkeypox is significantly more common in Italy than the US. This\r\nmay be due to a variety of factors, including quality of health,\r\naccessibility of healthcare, and the like. However, these numbers are\r\nsomewhat crude as of now due to how early it is in the outbreak, and may\r\nbe refined over the coming months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first glance, the current outbreak of monkeypox would appear to be\r\ndisproportionately affecting males, with over 95% of confirmed cases\r\nbeing recorded in such people. The dataset is from Global.health,\r\ncompiling individual case data originally from a number of governmental\r\ninstitutions worldwide. The data was then cleaned up and plotted in a\r\nstraightforward manner. While it may appear that monkeypox only impacts\r\nmen, this conclusion doesn’t complement past outbreaks, and is possibly\r\ndue to deficits in testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
